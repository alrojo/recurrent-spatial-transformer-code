Recurrent Spatial Transformer B-Trees
======================================
Code base is forked from Skaae's recurrent spatial transformer.
https://github.com/skaae/recurrent-spatial-transformer-code

In this project I test the use of recursive spartial transformers with num_crops per node being >= 2

The purpose is to create a dispersed spartial structure with an exponential amount of spartial structures.

The repository contains code for running

 * RNN-SPN model
